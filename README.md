python-bcd
==========

A binary-coded decimal conversion library for Python

Installation
------------
Clone the git repository, and then run `python setup.py install`

To use in python, use `import bcd`

Notes
-----

The functions work per-nibble, and the BCD should be seen as a string. An in-depth explanation is in https://github.com/dafyddcrosby/python-bcd/issues/1
